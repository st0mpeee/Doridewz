# Doridewz

This program should be considered malicious. It was created to become familiarized with the Win32 API and out of boredome.
Do not use on a system that is not yours.

Doridewz enumerates all local disks, finds every .EXE file, and replaces the icon with a mountain dew can. Effect is virtually permanent. There is currently no "undo" method.
