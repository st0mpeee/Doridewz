# Doridewz

This program was created to become familiarized with the Win32 API while having a bit of fun.
Do not use on a system that is not yours. Icons will be overwritten and there is no undo method.

Doridewz locates all .EXE files on any local disk it can find (might work on network drives as well, haven't tested). The icons inside the EXE are replaced with a Mountain Dew can. Planning to also replace the default shell system icons for text/dll/etc files.
